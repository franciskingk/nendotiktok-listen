Decide if you need to propose *SEARCH/REPLACE* edits for any code whose source is not available.\n   1a. You can create new files without asking!\n   1b. If you only need to change individual functions whose code you CAN see,\n       you may do so without having the entire file in the Workspace.\n   1c. Ask for additional files if you are blocked by visibility or best practices.\n        - **Do not stop** and ask for files just to add convenience methods, overloads, or helpers\n          in files that are not editable in your Workspace; if a valid solution is available, use it.\n        - **Do ask** if the alternative is an \"unnatural\" hack.\n          For example:\n          - If you need reflection to access a private member (ask for the file to relax visibility instead).\n          - If you would have to copy-paste significant logic (ask for the file to preserve DRY).\n        - **Do ask** if you do not have the APIs visible to confidently write a solution without guessing.\n          (Generally you do not need to insist on the full source when you have an api summary visible.)\n   1d. When refactoring or changing signatures, adopt a \"Closed World\" assumption.\n       Assume that the callers visible in the Workspace are the only ones that exist;\n       update those visible callers as needed and proceed.\n\n   If you need to propose changes to code you can't see,\n   tell the user their full class or file names and ask them to *add them to the Context*;\n   end your reply and wait for their approval.\n\n1. Explain the needed changes in a few short sentences.\n1. Give each change as a *SEARCH/REPLACE* block.\n\nIf an appropriate test file is in the Workspace, add or update tests to cover the changes you make.\nIf no such test file exists, only create a new one if instructed to do so.\n\nIf a file is read-only or unavailable, ask the user to add it or make it editable.\n\nIf you do not know how to use a dependency or API correctly, you MUST stop and ask the user for help.\n\nIf the user just says something like \"ok\" or \"go ahead\" or \"do that\", they probably want you\nto make SEARCH/REPLACE blocks for the code changes you just proposed.\nThe user will say when they've applied your edits.\nIf they haven't explicitly confirmed the edits have been applied, they probably want proper SEARCH/REPLACE blocks.\n\nAlways write elegant, well-encapsulated code that is easy to maintain and use without mistakes.\n\nAll changes to files must use the *SEARCH/REPLACE* block format in the rules section.\n</instructions>\n<rules>\nEXTENDED *SEARCH/REPLACE block* Rules:\n\nThe *SEARCH/REPLACE* engine supports multiple SEARCH types. Choose the most precise option that fits your edit.\nLine-based SEARCH remains the default for most changes.\n\n## SEARCH Type Priority\n\nUse the first row whose description matches the change you need:\n\n| Priority | Type | When to use |\n|----------|------|-------------|\n\n| 1 | Line-based | Default choice for localized edits |\n\n| 2 | `BRK_ENTIRE_FILE` | Creating a new file or rewriting most of a file |\n\nEvery *SEARCH/REPLACE block* must use this format:\n1. The opening fence: ```\n2. The *FULL* file path alone on a line, verbatim. No comment tokens, no bold asterisks, no quotes, no escaping of characters, etc.\n3. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH\n4. One of the following SEARCH types:\n  - Line-based SEARCH: a contiguous chunk of the EXACT lines to search for in the existing source code,\n\n\n  - Full-file SEARCH: a single line `BRK_ENTIRE_FILE` indicating replace-the-entire-file, or create-new-file\n5. The dividing line: =======\n6. The lines to replace into the source code\n7. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE\n8. The closing fence: ```\n\nALWAYS use the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user. No other text should appear on the marker lines.\n\nALWAYS base SEARCH/REPLACE blocks on the editable code in the Workspace. Excerpts of code or pseudocode\nmay be given in your goal, but this is NOT a source of truth of the current files' contents.\n\n## Examples (format only; illustrative, not real code)\nFollow these patterns exactly when you emit edits.\n### Before: Current Workspace excerpt\n\n<workspace_example>\n  <file path=\"src/main/java/com/acme/Foo.java\" fragmentid=\"1\">\n  package com.acme;\n\n  import java.util.List;\n  import java.util.Objects;\n\n  public class Foo {\n      public int compute(int a, int b) {\n          // naive implementation\n          return a + b;\n      }\n\n      /** A friendly greeting. */\n      public String greet(String name) {\n          return \"Hello, \" + name + \"!\";\n      }\n\n      private static int fib(int n) {\n          if (n <= 1) return n;\n          return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2);\n      }\n  }\n  </file>\n</workspace_example>\n\n\n### Example 1 — Line-based SEARCH (modify a fragment outside of a method)\n\n```\nsrc/main/java/com/acme/Foo.java\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\nimport java.util.List;\nimport java.util.Objects;\n=======\nimport java.util.List;\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n\n### Example 2 — Full-file replacement (BRK_ENTIRE_FILE)\n\n```\nsrc/main/java/com/acme/Foo.java\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\nBRK_ENTIRE_FILE\n=======\npackage com.acme;\n\npublic class Foo {\n    public int compute(int a, int b) {\n        return Math.addExact(a, b);\n    }\n\n    public String greet(String name) {\n        return \"Hello, \" + name + \"!\";\n    }\n\n    private static int fib(int n) {\n        if (n < 2) return n;\n        int a = 0, b = 1;\n        for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {\n            int next = Math.addExact(a, b);\n            a = b;\n            b = next;\n        }\n        return b;\n    }\n}\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n*SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will *fail* to apply if the SEARCH payload matches multiple occurrences in the content.\nFor line-based edits, this means you must include enough lines to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change,\nand avoid using syntax-aware edits for overloaded functions.\n\nKeep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.\nBreak large changes into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion.\n\nAvoid generating overlapping *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks, combine them into a single edit.\nIf you want to move code within a filename, use 2 blocks: one to delete from the old location,\nand one to insert in the new location.\n\nPay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking\nyou to create a new filename.\n\nNEVER use smart quotes in your *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks, not even in comments.  ALWAYS\nuse vanilla ascii single and double quotes.\n\nWhen generating *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks, choose the most precise SEARCH type that fits your change:\n- Line-based SEARCH is the primary option for most edits. Use it for adding, modifying, or removing localized\n  blocks of code, including new methods or inner classes in existing files. Include the changing lines plus a\n  few surrounding lines only when needed for uniqueness.\n\n\n- Use `BRK_ENTIRE_FILE` when you are creating a brand new file, or when you are intentionally rewriting most\n  of an existing file so that a whole-file replacement is clearer than multiple smaller edits.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: The `BRK_` tokens are NEVER part of the file content, they are entity locators used only in SEARCH.\nWhen writing REPLACE blocks, do **not** repeat the `BRK_` line.\nThe REPLACE block must ALWAYS contain ONLY the valid code (annotations, signature, body) that will overwrite the target.\n\nFollow the existing code style, and ONLY EVER RETURN CHANGES IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!\n\nAvoid changing code or comments that are not directly related to the request.\n\nDo not comment on your modifications, only on the resulting code in isolation.\nYou must never output any comments about the progress or type of changes of your refactoring or generation.\nFor example, you must NOT add comments like: 'Added dependency' or 'Changed to new style' or worst of all 'Keeping existing implementation'.\n\n<goal>\npush the code to master branch and i'll try redeploy it.\n</goal>\nYou are diligent and tireless!\nYou NEVER leave comments describing code without implementing it!\nYou always COMPLETELY IMPLEMENT the needed code without pausing to ask if you should continue!\n</rules>\n"

Key issues discovered: frontend code (notably frontend/src/hooks/useTikTokData.ts) contains hardcoded localhost API URLs (e.g. http://127.0.0.1:8001) so deployed frontend cannot reach the backend; api.py is written to run with uvicorn.run (not structured as a Vercel serverless function) and CORS is permissive (security risk); requirements include playwright which complicates serverless deployment. Recommended next steps for the developer to commit: (1) make frontend API base URL configurable via environment variables and add .env.example and README deployment instructions; (2) adapt backend for the chosen deployment target—either convert to Vercel serverless by placing an app-exporting file under api/index.py (remove uvicorn.run entrypoint) and add a root vercel.json to route /api/* to the Python function, or deploy backend separately (Render/Railway) and point frontend to that URL; (3) handle/playwright dependency (use a separate service or specialized buildpack) or remove it if not required for server runtime; (4) tighten CORS to restrict origins; (5) ensure frontend build output and Vercel config target the frontend/dist and do not rewrite API routes to index.html; and note I cannot commit or push changes—please apply the above edits and then commit/push so you can deploy.\n</task>\n\n\n<task sequence=2 summarized=true>\n  Repo: franciskingk/nendo-tiktok-bot — user asked to \"commit the changes here and I will deploy\"; analysis found a mixed Python FastAPI backend (api.py, uvicorn.run, permissive CORS) and a React/Vite frontend in frontend/, deployed to Vercel which returned a 404; root causes and deployment blockers: frontend hardcodes API calls to http://127.0.0.1:8001 in frontend/src/hooks/useTikTokData.ts (and potentially other files), frontend/vercel.json rewrites all routes to index.html so /api/* is swallowed, backend not structured as Vercel serverless (api.py not in api/ and uses uvicorn), scraper.py depends on Playwright which complicates serverless deployment, backend persists config/data to local JSON which won't survive ephemeral deployments. Recommended changes to commit before deployment: 1) refactor frontend to use an environment variable (import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL) and add frontend/.env.example; 2) add or adjust vercel.json at repo root and set Vercel project root to frontend (or create proper monorepo config) or alternatively plan to deploy backend separately (Render/Railway/Fly.io/Docker); 3) refactor backend to export the FastAPI app (no uvicorn.run) and/or move it into api/ for Vercel functions if you choose Vercel; 4) make backend config/data use environment variables and avoid local JSON persistence or add durable storage; 5) document required env vars and deployment steps in README and consider handling Playwright via a separate service or Docker image.\n</task>\n\n\n<task sequence=3 summarized=true>\n  Refactor frontend/src/hooks/useTikTokData.ts to remove all hardcoded occurrences of http://127.0.0.1:8001 and replace them with a single API_BASE_URL constant derived from import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL || 'http://127.0.0.1:8001'; update all fetch calls in that file to use API_BASE_URL; add frontend/.env.example documenting VITE_API_URL; ensure frontend/.env is listed in .gitignore if a .gitignore exists.

    "reasoning_content" : "**Finalizing Deployment Prep**\n\nI'm now focusing on the final steps for deployment. Based on recent tasks, I'm working to consolidate the necessary changes for the main branch on GitHub, particularly addressing Vercel-specific issues. I am verifying the identified fixes are sufficient to complete deployment.\n\n\n**Addressing Deployment Issues**\n\nI've made progress on several critical issues. I've updated `frontend/src/hooks/useTikTokData.ts` to use `import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL` instead of the hardcoded localhost address, as suggested. Also, I'm refactoring `api.py` to read configuration from environment variables, which will ensure persistence in a serverless environment. This should address the core conflicts with Vercel's architecture.\n\n\n**Requesting Editable File Access**\n\nI've identified an immediate need to modify `frontend/src/hooks/useTikTokData.ts` to fully address the localhost URL issue. Currently, I cannot edit this file directly, and I must request its addition to the editable workspace to proceed. I have the other files, such as `api.py`, `.gitignore`, and `frontend/.env.example` ready to be modified once the request for the missing file is handled. I am therefore awaiting instructions regarding that new file.\n\n\n**Confirming Necessary Edits**\n\nI've clarified the immediate next step based on the provided instructions. I need to focus on editing `api.py` and potentially `.env` now that I've confirmed their editability. The most critical issue is the `frontend/src/hooks/useTikTokData.ts` fix. Since the user said I must ensure that essential edits are made, and that file is unavailable, I need to confirm its availability to be edited before proceeding. Also, the user mentioned committing to the main branch which I cannot do myself.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Task Scope**\n\nI've re-evaluated my approach, deciding to prioritize the explicitly requested tasks. My primary focus is the hardcoded URL in the frontend and backend configuration, and I've confirmed I can access the code for `frontend/src/hooks/useTikTokData.ts` through a special summary section; however, it's read-only. I'm now requesting that the file itself, and its read-write counterpart, be added to the editable context. Additionally, I'll update `api.py`, `.gitignore`, and `frontend/.env.example`.\n\n\n**Clarifying Action Steps**\n\nI'm now clarifying the next action, as the user stated I must \"ensure the changes have been made.\" Currently, I'm requesting that `frontend/src/hooks/useTikTokData.ts` and its editability be added, even though it's visible. While the summary might be incomplete or outdated, I'm unable to confidently generate a SEARCH/REPLACE block for a file not in the editable context, even if the user can technically access it; therefore, adding it is the correct course of action.\n\n\n**Evaluating File Editability**\n\nI am now carefully evaluating the editability requirement. Although I *can* see the complete contents of `frontend/src/hooks/useTikTokData.ts`, I cannot directly edit it in the workspace. I'm aware the instructions explicitly state to base search/replace blocks on editable code. Therefore, I'm requesting the file's editability be confirmed.\n\n\n**Confirming Readability Requirements**\n\nI'm now focusing on the implications of editability versus readability. I can view `frontend/src/hooks/useTikTokData.ts`, so I can see the code needing changes. However, I can't directly edit it in the editable context, meaning I still need to request the file be added to the editable context before making changes. I'll stick to this process and move step by step, which is a safe approach.\n\n\n**Confirming Read/Write Access**\n\nI'm working on verifying access to the file I need to modify, specifically `frontend/src/hooks/useTikTokData.ts`. While I can view the contents, direct editability is currently blocked. I'll hold off on editing `api.py` and `.env.example` until I have edit permissions for the crucial `useTikTokData.ts` file, ensuring a synchronized approach.\n\n\n**Clarifying Access Concerns**\n\nI'm now seeking clarification on the editability status of `frontend/src/hooks/useTikTokData.ts`. My concern centers on whether its absence from the `workspace_editable` block implies a true lack of edit permissions, even if I can view the file. I want to ensure my actions align with the instruction to base changes on editable code. Therefore, I'm requesting explicit confirmation regarding this file's editability, prior to making changes to other files.\n\n\n**Confirming Editable Context**\n\nI'm now fully focused on the definitive instruction regarding the editable context. Recent analysis confirms I can't directly edit `frontend/src/hooks/useTikTokData.ts` even if I can view it; therefore, I must request its addition to the editable workspace to proceed with the URL change, per explicit instructions. My process will adhere to the specified criteria.\n\n\n**Considering Scraper.py Dependencies**\n\nI'm now expanding my considerations to include `scraper.py`. While I haven't explicitly been asked to modify it, its dependencies and usage within `api.py` raise potential issues for Vercel deployment. Since `api.py` is editable, I can address this by wrapping the import of `scraper`, rather than editing it directly. I'll maintain focus on files in the editable context.\n\n\n"

Frontend (React & TypeScript)\n\n### Component Patterns\n- **Functional Components**: Use `export const ComponentName = (...) => { ... }` rather than function declarations.\n- **Conditional Styling**: Use the `cn()` utility (based on `clsx` and `tailwind-merge`) for all dynamic class merging.\n- **Prop Interfaces**: Define `interface ComponentProps` immediately above the component. Use `React.ElementType` for props that accept Lucide icons.\n- **Icon Rendering**: Render dynamic icons using the `<item.icon />` syntax by assigning the icon to a lowercase variable or property.\n\n### State & Navigation\n- **View Management**: Use a `currentView` string and `onNavigate` callback pattern for simple SPA navigation within a dashboard layout.\n- **Controlled Collapsibles**: Prefer manual state management (`collapsed`, `setCollapsed`) for sidebars to ensure precise control over layout transitions.\n\n### Project Configuration\n- **Path Aliasing**: Use the `@/` prefix to reference the `src` directory, configured via Vite and TypeScript.\n- **Vite Plugins**: Use `@vitejs/plugin-react-swc` for faster builds and HMR.\n\n## 2. Python (Streamlit & Scraping)\n\n### Module Architecture\n- **Sync/Async Hybrid**: Implement core logic (like scrapers) using `async` methods, but provide `_sync` wrapper functions using `asyncio.run()` for compatibility with Streamlit’s synchronous execution model.\n- **Resource Management**: Use `@st.cache_resource` for singleton-like objects such as database managers (`SheetsManager`) or ML analyzers (`TikTokAnalyzer`).\n\n### Data Handling\n- **Pandas Integration**: Return `pd.DataFrame` from all analysis and data retrieval methods.\n- **Defensive Mapping**: When parsing external API results (e.g., Apify), use a private `_map_result` method with extensive `.get()` calls and `try/except` blocks to handle inconsistent JSON schemas.\n- **Data Deduplication**: Maintain a `set` of unique identifiers (e.g., `video_id`) when appending data to external storage (Google Sheets) to prevent duplicates.\n\n### UI & Visualization\n- **Session State**: Explicitly initialize all state variables (e.g., `data_loaded`, `df`) at the start of the `app.py`.\n- **Plotly Configuration**: Use `rgba(0,0,0,0)` for `plot_bgcolor` and `paper_bgcolor` to ensure charts blend seamlessly with the Streamlit theme.\n- **Progressive Columns**: Use `st.column_config` (e.g., `ProgressColumn`, `LinkColumn`) to turn standard DataFrames into interactive dashboards.\n\n## 3. General Conventions\n\n### External Integrations\n- **Google Sheets**: Treat the first row of a worksheet as the schema definition. Automatically initialize headers if `row_values(1)` is empty.\n- **Environment Variables**: Use `os.getenv()` as a fallback for API tokens, but prioritize explicit parameter passing for flexibility.\n\n### Error Handling\n- **Visual Feedback**: Use `st.sidebar.error` or `st.sidebar.warning` instead of generic print statements for user-facing errors in the dashboard.\n- **Silent Failures**: In mapping functions or loops, use `continue` within `try/except` blocks to ensure a single malformed data point doesn't crash the entire ingestion pipeline.\n</project_guide>\n\n<workspace>\n<workspace_readonly>\nHere are the READ ONLY files and code fragments in your Workspace.\nDo not edit this code!
