      Reasoning:
      **Initiating Deployment Strategy**
      
      I'm focusing on the deployment plan, considering the FastAPI backend (`api.py`) and the frontend setup within the `frontend` directory (including `package.json` and `vite.config.ts`). The presence of `requirements.txt` is important for managing dependencies. I'm prioritizing how to best trigger deployment following the user's intent to "commit the changes here".
      
      
      **Analyzing Deployment Requirements**
      
      I'm now investigating potential deployment configuration conflicts, specifically with the FastAPI backend and React frontend. The `vercel.json` rewrite suggests Vercel is handling client-side routing, but it may not address the API. I'm focusing on the 404 error, as well as the need to resolve whether the backend can be deployed alongside the frontend in Vercel.
      
      
      **Investigating Vercel Configuration**
      
      I'm now zeroing in on the Vercel setup. I've realized the structure with `api.py` at the root and `frontend` in a subdirectory is important for Vercel. I'm focusing on how Vercel handles the backend, especially given the "404: NOT_FOUND" error. I need to verify that there isn't a conflict between the API route and the frontend routing, and confirm if there are missing or misconfigured elements for deployment. The goal is to ensure both backend and frontend deploy correctly, responding to the user's intent.
      
      
      **Formulating Deployment Strategy**
      
      I'm now formulating the deployment strategy, focusing on the configuration needed for Vercel, specifically for the FastAPI backend. I see `api.py` exposes the `app` object, which is good. The existing `frontend/vercel.json` only covers the frontend; I'm hypothesizing we need a root `vercel.json` to configure the backend deployment as well, given the "404: NOT_FOUND" error. I'm exploring the root directory for potential deployment configuration files. The prompt "commit the changes here" suggests the goal is a fully deployable code state. I'm also checking other files.

      Reasoning:
      **Preparing for Deployment**
      
      I'm focusing on the user's intent to deploy a platform, specifically the code in the GitHub repository `https://github.com/franciskingk/nendo-tiktok-bot.git`. My current thinking is centered around ensuring the codebase is fully prepared for deployment. This means verifying commits are complete.
      
      
      **Analyzing Deployment Environment**
      
      I've determined the git URL likely represents the upstream repository. The "commit the changes here" request is interpreted as "prepare for deployment." I can address this by fixing any obvious issues. I'm also examining the 404 error, which seems like a Vercel-related issue, and looking at the existing configuration files, especially `frontend/vercel.json` and `frontend/vite.config.ts`.
      
      
      **Evaluating Deployment Strategies**
      
      I'm now considering the best deployment strategy, given the structure of the project. I've realized the Python backend, with `api.py` at the root, poses a challenge for Vercel's typical frontend and serverless function focus. My thinking leans towards either adapting the backend for Vercel functions, or deploying it separately. I'm focusing on how `vercel.json` would configure the backend build and routes. The existing 404 error reinforces the need to pinpoint how the frontend interacts with this backend.
      
      
      **Diagnosing Frontend Routing**
      
      I see a routing issue; the `vercel.json`'s rewrite rule directs all traffic to `index.html`, suitable for an SPA. I'm focusing on "commit the changes here" - I need to figure out which changes are required. The key files are `api.py` and the `frontend/` directory. Deploying the full platform means deploying both the frontend and backend. I'm also considering deploying the Python API as a Vercel Serverless Function, which would require restructuring the code (likely placing `api.py` in an `api/` directory). If it is a frontend 404 error, I'll need to check the build output. The frontend's `package.json` specifies `"vite build"`, which defaults to the `dist` directory.
      
      
      **Refining Deployment Configuration**
      
      I'm now zeroing in on configuring the deployment. My current focus is how the frontend will interact with the backend and how to define the build output. The `vercel.json` rewrite to `index.html` is the current route and entry point. The fact that `api.py` is a standalone script and the Vite configuration in `frontend/vite.config.ts` are both key to the solution. The 404 error is almost certainly a Vercel deployment issue. The Vite project is in a `frontend` subdirectory of the repo's root.
      
      
      **Confirming Deployment Structure**
      
      I'm now confirming the deployment structure based on the provided configuration. I understand the frontend resides in the `frontend` directory, which is a React environment. I've noted the build command, output directory, and the significance of the `frontend/vercel.json` file. My focus is on ensuring the Vercel project is correctly configured to handle both the frontend and the backend within the monorepo structure, especially considering the project root and possible missing configurations.
      
      
      **Investigating Deployment Failures**
      
      I'm now zeroing in on the cause of the 404 error. The styling suggests a Vercel default, not application logic. My working hypothesis is a deployment failure: either an incorrect build output configuration or, possibly, a misconfigured route. I've ruled out the possibility of a local issue, based on the error ID. I'm checking the `frontend/package.json` build script. I've confirmed a mixed repository, without root-level Vercel or package files, which supports Vercel's Python option, if requested.
      
      
      **Resolving Deployment Configurations**
      
      I'm now zeroing in on configuring the deployment. My current focus is how the frontend will interact with the backend and fixing the 404. I've realized the existing `vercel.json` config uses a legacy setup. It rewrites to `index.html`, and routes to `api.py`. I now remember how to solve this. I must ensure the needed files and dependencies are included for Vercel functions to resolve imports.

      Reasoning:
      **Analyzing Deployment Failure**
      
      I'm currently focused on resolving the deployment failure. I've received a git URL for the repository, and, along with that, an image depicting a 404 error, which strongly suggests a resource not found issue. My current efforts are concentrated on tracing the root cause and devising a reliable workaround.
      
      
      **Investigating Project Structure**
      
      I'm now examining the project structure to understand how the frontend and backend interact. I've noted the presence of `api.py` (FastAPI), React components (`frontend/`), and deployment configurations like `vercel.json`. The user's request suggests a focus on deployment readiness. The 404 error, likely a Vercel function invocation ID, is pointing towards either backend unavailability, frontend routing problems, or non-existent API endpoints. I'm prioritizing `api.py` for potential issues.
      
      
      **Tracing API Endpoints**
      
      I'm now tracing API endpoints called by the frontend. My focus has shifted to identifying API calls within the frontend, primarily by examining `frontend/src/App.tsx`. I'll search for `fetch`, `axios`, or `/api/` usages within `frontend/src`. Furthermore, I've noticed `api.py` uses `uvicorn.run`. This is not the standard Vercel setup. I must determine how the backend is deployed on Vercel, given the lack of a corresponding configuration in `vercel.json` for the Python backend.
      
      
      **Clarifying Deployment Intent**
      
      I'm now clarifying the deployment intent, suspecting a misconfiguration for Vercel. I'm reviewing the presence (or absence) of a root `vercel.json` and scrutinizing the frontend's API calls. The existing `frontend/vercel.json` hints at a potential separation between frontend and backend deployments, but the 404 error suggests a Vercel-specific issue. I am exploring whether the backend might be deployed elsewhere. The goal is to determine if the deployment target is Vercel for both, only the frontend, or elsewhere entirely.

      Reasoning:
      **Preparing for Deployment**
      
      I see a clear directive to prepare for deployment of the TikTok bot project. The user's goal is to commit changes to the provided GitHub repository, `https://github.com/franciskingk/nendo-tiktok-bot.git`, and then deploy the platform. I'm focusing on resolving a potential 404 error, as per the user's implicit feedback, and making the repository deployment-ready.
      
      
      **Analyzing the Error**
      
      I am now delving into the root cause of the 404 error, suspecting a configuration issue with the frontend-backend interaction, or frontend routing. Specifically, I'm analyzing the `frontend/vercel.json` file, which includes a rewrite for SPA, to ensure its correct implementation. It is important to confirm that the deployment environment is correctly handling client-side routing.
      
      
      **Investigating API Connectivity**
      
      I'm now investigating how the frontend constructs its API URLs, since the current setup may route API requests to the frontend. I've confirmed the backend listens on port 8001 and the frontend on 8081, with no proxy configuration. I'm reviewing file search results for usages of `/api/` and relevant URLs, to ensure the frontend calls the correct backend endpoint.
      
      
      **Examining API Interactions**
      
      I'm now examining how the frontend interacts with the backend API, focusing on `frontend/src/hooks/useTikTokData.ts` and `frontend/src/pages/Index.tsx`. I'll identify any hardcoded API endpoints, particularly `localhost:8001`. Given the Vercel deployment context, the current setup may require adjustments to handle the frontend and backend correctly. My next step will be to explore Python serverless functions for the backend within Vercel's framework, either via an `api/` directory or `vercel.json` configurations.
      
      
      **Refactoring Deployment Configuration**
      
      I'm now investigating the Vercel deployment structure for this project, and I'm updating my approach. The absence of a root `vercel.json` file raises questions about the platform's deployment strategy. I'm focusing on adapting the current setup to match Vercel's preferred monorepo structure, specifically configuring the backend as a serverless function and adjusting the routing to direct API requests to it. My next steps involve refactoring the `api.py` to export the `app` instance and testing whether the existing frontend routing works.
      
      
      **Diagnosing Root Causes**
      
      I believe the 404 error stems from Vercel's routing, specifically when the frontend tries to access `/api/settings`. It seems Vercel isn't aware of the backend since the setup lacks the configuration to build or serve the backend alongside the frontend. The screenshot confirms the error originates at the Vercel platform level, not within the React app. I hypothesize that either the project is missing a root configuration for the monorepo setup, or the frontend hardcodes `localhost` which needs adjustment for deployment.

      Reasoning:
      **Analyzing Deployment Instructions**
      
      I'm interpreting the user's instructions regarding the deployment of a platform, focusing on the provided GitHub repository. The user seems to expect that committing changes to their repository is the trigger for deployment. I'm focusing on the repository URL. I understand that the repository needs to be updated.
      
      
      **Addressing Production Readiness**
      
      I've pinpointed several critical production readiness issues. The FastAPI backend (`api.py`) allows all origins, a security risk, and requires configuring the frontend URL. The frontend's TikTok data hook (`useTikTokData.ts`) hardcodes a local API address that will fail. The `vercel.json` rewrite handles frontend routing. If Vercel functions are being used, this backend needs routing.
      
      
      **Clarifying Vercel Deployment**
      
      I'm now focusing on deploying both frontend and backend to Vercel. I've realized `api.py` likely needs adaptation (e.g., `vercel.json`). The frontend must know the production API URL. The 404 error suggests a Vercel-specific issue. I can't commit, but I understand the user means making changes for commit/deploy.
      
      
      
      **Defining Deployment Architecture**
      
      I'm now focusing on defining the deployment architecture. Considering the possibility of the backend also being on Vercel, I am thinking through the configuration needs for that, particularly in relation to `api/index.py` or the application of rewrite rules within `vercel.json`. However, if the backend is hosted elsewhere, then the front-end will need to point to the correct URL. The file structure indicates a monorepo or project combining both Python and React code. My goal is to make the application deployable, focusing on front-end assets and a backend running as Serverless Functions, likely under `/api`.
      
      
      **Refining Deployment Steps**
      
      I'm now refining the deployment steps. I missed a key point; there might be missing configuration in `vercel.json` and in `useTikTokData.ts`. It seems that `api.py` will not work as-is on Vercel, I'll need to check the API directory for `index.py`. I want to verify that `useTikTokData.ts` has a hardcoded URL. I'm moving toward a task list: refactoring the frontend to use environment variables for the API URL, and configuring the deployment on Vercel. I need to make a `vercel.json` file.
      
      
      **Confirming Deployment Configuration**
      
      I'm now confirming the deployment configuration steps. The 404 error confirms this is a Vercel-specific issue and that I must deploy *this* repository. I plan to search for any environment variable usage in the frontend and confirm the `api` directory exists, or look for a configuration. Then, I will modify `useTikTokData.ts`. It seems the root is Python-centric and the `frontend` directory contains the React application. I must configure both properly to deploy to Vercel as a monorepo, requiring separate settings for Python and React.
      
      
      **Formulating Deployment Plan**
      
      I'm now formulating the deployment plan, integrating the `vercel.json` example. I'm focusing on the necessity of adapting `api.py` and the need to expose the `app` object for Vercel. I will prune unnecessary workspace fragments. I need to get the changes into the code. The user's specific request to "commit the changes here" provides further direction.
      
      
      
      **Implementing Code Changes**
      
      I'm now implementing the code changes to match the deployment plan. I need to address the hardcoded API URL in `useTikTokData.ts` and make it configurable. I'm focusing on the Vercel configuration, specifically creating the root `vercel.json` file to manage both the Python API and React frontend. I will now examine `requirements.txt` which seems to suggest that there is a difficult `playwright` dependency. I must address the implications of this.

      **Initiating Deployment Preparations**
      
      I'm focusing on the deployment process now. The provided GitHub URL hints at a Git repository, and the "commit the changes" language suggests I need to finalize any pending modifications before proceeding. I'm preparing to finalize the deployment.
      
      
      **Analyzing Deployment Constraints**
      
      I've hit a snag. As an AI, I can't directly interact with Git to commit or push. The user likely wants me to prepare the codebase for them. My assessment shows Python/FastAPI for the backend and React/Vite for the frontend, with a `vercel.json` file. I'm focusing on why a 404 error occurred; the frontend, especially `useTikTokData.ts`, might have hardcoded URLs that need adjustment.
      
      
      **Addressing URL Dependency Issues**
      
      I'm now zeroing in on the hardcoded localhost URLs. It's clear those are the main roadblocks to deployment. My current plan involves refactoring `frontend/src/hooks/useTikTokData.ts` to utilize environment variables or relative paths. I'm also ensuring the existence of an `.env` file to manage these variables. Furthermore, I've confirmed that the CORS settings in `api.py` are currently permissive. Now, I need to thoroughly examine the mentioned file for precise identification of those problematic URLs. I need to be exact here.
      
      
      **Confirming Code Analysis**
      
      I've got the full content of `useTikTokData.ts`, confirming the hardcoded fetch calls. Now, I've outlined a refactoring plan: I'll create tasks to implement environment variables for the frontend API calls, add a `.env.example` file, and optionally update the `README.md` with deployment instructions. I'm also considering the user's "commit the changes" request, which might include fixing the 404 error, and I'm analyzing the provided image details.
      
      
      **Investigating 404 Origin**
      
      I've shifted my focus to the 404 error's source. Initial assumptions pointed to frontend URL issues, but now I suspect the backend is the root cause: The "Video not found" indicates a runtime error. However, a Vercel trace ID in the error suggests a serverless function crash or routing issue. I'm verifying the backend deployment status. The `vercel.json` file now gains more significance with its potential rewrites.
      
      
      **Clarifying Deployment Dependencies**
      
      I'm now identifying critical dependencies for a successful deployment. The existing `vercel.json` rewrites all requests to `index.html`, which handles client-side routing. This means backend API calls, such as those made by the frontend to `/api/...`, must be routed to a live backend. The user's mention of "nendo-tiktok-bot" implies a required backend. The existing `api.py` (FastAPI) backend isn't configured for Vercel Serverless, so a separate backend deployment (e.g., Render, Railway) is needed. My immediate focus is on making the frontend API URL configurable to point to this production backend instance.
      
      
      **Formulating Deployment Tasks**
      
      I'm now formulating specific tasks for deployment preparation. The plan now includes externalizing the API base URL in the frontend via environment variables. I'll also add a deployment configuration file, like a `Procfile`, for the backend. The `requirements.txt` looks fine. I'll examine the frontend's `vite.config.ts`, which does not have a proxy, and the backend runs on port 8001. Finally, I'll ensure there are no other hardcoded URLs.
      
      
      **Verifying Component URLs**
      
      I'm now checking `frontend/src/components/dashboard/VideoTable.tsx` for any direct API calls or URL dependencies, to ensure I haven't overlooked any hardcoded references. The `useTikTokData.ts` seems like the primary hook, but I'm being thorough, and I will confirm `frontend/src/main.tsx` doesn't have any URL dependencies. My next step will be to implement the environment variable changes in the frontend.
      
      
      
      **Refining Deployment Strategy**
      
      I'm now refining the deployment plan based on further analysis. I can see the user deployed, but the frontend's requests to `/api/...` are being rewritten to `index.html`, leading to a 404. Hardcoded `http://127.0.0.1:8001/...` URLs cause mixed content errors. A deployed backend URL is essential. I'll focus on frontend URL configuration and backend deployment preparation. I'll also note that `playwright`'s browser dependency can complicate serverless deployments, needing specific buildpacks. I'm re-examining `api.py` imports.

      **Diagnosing Deployment Issue**
      
      I'm assessing the Vercel 404 error, specifically code NOT_FOUND ID cpt1::nzjrh-1771587387906-2a2a939be118. My initial thought is it's a missing route or misconfigured build. I'm investigating potential causes, like incorrect build paths or missing files in the deployment package. Next, I plan to check the Vercel deployment settings and code routes.
      
      
      **Analyzing Configuration Errors**
      
      I've examined the codebase more closely, and I see the root cause. The `useTikTokData.ts` file in the React frontend has hardcoded API URLs referencing localhost, which explains the failures. I'm thinking of setting up environment variable configurations (like `VITE_API_URL`) to fix the backend address. Also, the project's structure suggests a monorepo, so I need to decide the best path for deployment, such as Vercel Serverless Functions or a separate backend platform.
      
      
      **Addressing Deployment Architecture**
      
      I'm now focusing on deploying the entire system; frontend and backend. The Python backend, implied by `requirements.txt` and `api.py`, poses a challenge to Vercel's standard serverless function setup. Although it might require adjustments, the frontend's 404 suggests this needs attention. I'm investigating the best approach, considering the uvicorn process, build output directories, and the need for the frontend to correctly point to the backend's eventual deployed location. I am also planning on updating the build process for Vercel.
      
      
      **Refining Environment Configuration**
      
      I'm now zeroing in on configuring environment variables. I need to update the frontend, like the hardcoded API URLs in the TypeScript file, to use the `VITE_API_URL` environment variable. I'll need to confirm that `frontend/vite.config.ts` handles proxying in development and correctly uses the environment variable during the build. Also, I must ensure `vercel.json` is correctly set up, especially if deploying from the root. It may need to manage both frontend and potential Python backend deployments or direct the frontend to a deployed backend.
      
      
      **Confirming Vercel Deployment**
      
      I've shifted my focus. Now, I suspect the primary issue centers on how the user deployed to Vercel and how the frontend is configured. I'm hypothesizing about the Vercel deployment root, and possible pathing problems. I am certain that if the `frontend` directory is not correctly specified in Vercel settings, I will likely encounter problems with finding and deploying the `index.html` file.
      
      
      **Revising Deployment Strategy**
      
      I'm now seriously considering alternative strategies. The 404 could indeed be backend-related if the user tested endpoints such as `/api/health`. I'm concerned about dependencies like `playwright` in `scraper.py`, as it's often problematic for Vercel's serverless environment, which imports `TikTokScraper` which uses `playwright`. I will prioritize fixing the hardcoded URLs in `useTikTokData.ts` and also double check and configure `vercel.json`. It is also possible I need to move `api.py`.
      
      
      **Evaluating Deployment Platforms**
      
      I've realized that deploying the backend to Vercel is highly unlikely because of Playwright's size. My current assessment leans toward deployment with Docker on platforms like Render, Railway, or Fly.io. The user's prompt to "commit changes and I will deploy" strongly implies a non-Vercel deployment target, possibly a VPS or buildpack-based system. Given the 404, they may have already tried Vercel. I'm going to update the config.
      
      
      
      **Prioritizing Frontend Configuration**
      
      I'm now zeroing in on a focused strategy to resolve this. My key goal is to get the frontend working, so I'm updating my approach to include the backend. I'm prioritizing the frontend's hardcoded URLs, and it will involve refactoring those. I'm focusing on creating an environment variable to fix these URLs. I'm looking at two specific tasks right now. I'm going to set up `vercel.json` and deploy it.
      
      
      **Updating Vercel Build**
      
      I'm now zeroing in on configuring a Vercel deployment with the project's root as the deployment directory. To facilitate proper single-page application routing, I'm aiming to add a `vercel.json` file at the project root, even though one exists in the frontend folder. This will clarify how the frontend routes, especially since the existing `frontend/vercel.json` rewrites `/(.*)` to `/index.html`. It should be straightforward.
      
      
      **Confirming Frontend Configuration**
      
      I'm now zeroing in on confirming the root directory in the Vercel configuration. It is critical. I've decided my primary focus needs to be to refactor the frontend, the `useTikTokData.ts` file, to use environment variables for the API URL. I'm going to generate an environment variable file (`.env.local`) and configure Vite in `frontend/vite.config.ts`. Additionally, I will add a root-level `vercel.json` file. Finally, I will commit the changes.
      
      
      **Refining Configuration Tasks**
      
      I'm now zeroing in on a precise plan. I've broken the task into two clear steps: configuring environment variables in the frontend and ensuring the Vercel configuration is correct, which seems more straightforward. I will begin by making `useTikTokData.ts` use `import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL` and creating a `.env.example` in the frontend. Additionally, I'll carefully check `frontend/vercel.json` to avoid making another redundant entry.
      
      
      **Verifying Fragment Persistence**
      
      I'm now investigating a discrepancy in fragment handling. The `workspace_toc` indicates that `Summary of frontend\vercel.json` still exists as a fragment, despite a previous `FragmentRemoval` call. I'm focusing on whether the removal was processed correctly, if the fragment was inadvertently re-added, or if the system's tracking is inconsistent. I need to figure out why this fragment persists.
      
      
      
      **Clarifying Fragment Status**
      
      I'm now investigating fragment persistence. It seems the summary of `frontend/vercel.json` is still present, even after a supposed removal. I'm focusing on why these fragments, along with those for `frontend/index.html` and `requirements.txt`, remain despite the full content residing in `workspace_editable`. My plan is to explicitly drop these summaries to reduce clutter. I also have enough information to create a task list to provide to the user, who now has the tasks below.
      
      \n\n
      **Defining Solution Steps**
      
      I've outlined the core tasks now. First, I need to configure the API URL in the frontend, specifically updating `useTikTokData.ts` to use `import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL` for externalization. Second, I'm generating a `frontend/.env.example` file to define that variable. CORS in `api.py` allows `*`, good for now. I will create the task list.
      
      
      **Adding Backend Robustness**
      
      I'm now integrating tasks to address the backend's deployment configuration, since I'm concerned about the local file configuration. I'll add a task to make the backend configuration load from environment variables and also warn about using local file storage which won't persist across deployments. My ultimate goal is to improve deployment robustness. My main plan is to prioritize environment variables, and avoid local persistence.
      
      
      
      \n\nI'm now zeroing in on completing the core deployment tasks. I have a more refined task list ready: (1) update frontend URL usage; (2) refactor backend config loading to use env vars; (3) confirm Vercel Root Directory setting. This simplifies initial deployment. I'm prioritizing these critical elements.

      # Explanation
      
      I have identified the key issues preventing a successful deployment:
      1.  **Hardcoded Localhost URLs**: The frontend (`useTikTokData.ts`) is hardcoded to connect to `http://127.0.0.1:8001`. This will fail in production. I will update it to use an environment variable `VITE_API_URL`.
      2.  **Configuration Persistence**: The backend relies on local JSON files (`config.json`, `data_cache.json`) which may not persist in many deployment environments (like Vercel or ephemeral containers). I will update the backend to allow configuration via environment variables as a robust fallback.
      3.  **Missing Environment Examples**: I will create `.env.example` files to document the required variables for deployment.
      
      This plan prepares the codebase for deployment by making the connection strings and credentials configurable via standard environment variables.

**Summarizing task details**

I need to provide a concise summary for a third party without any additional text or line breaks. The summary should explain the repository and the user's request related to commit changes and deployment. Key issues include a hardcoded API URL pointing to localhost, which causes Vercel 404 errors, and complications from using Playwright in a serverless environment. The tasks involve refactoring the frontend, adding configuration files, and updating backend settings. It's essential to keep it concise while covering all critical points.

## text
Repo: franciskingk/nendo-tiktok-bot — user asked to "commit the changes here and I will deploy"; analysis found a mixed Python FastAPI backend (api.py, uvicorn.run, permissive CORS) and a React/Vite frontend in frontend/, deployed to Vercel which returned a 404; root causes and deployment blockers: frontend hardcodes API calls to http://127.0.0.1:8001 in frontend/src/hooks/useTikTokData.ts (and potentially other files), frontend/vercel.json rewrites all routes to index.html so /api/* is swallowed, backend not structured as Vercel serverless (api.py not in api/ and uses uvicorn), scraper.py depends on Playwright which complicates serverless deployment, backend persists config/data to local JSON which won't survive ephemeral deployments. Recommended changes to commit before deployment: 1) refactor frontend to use an environment variable (import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL) and add frontend/.env.example; 2) add or adjust vercel.json at repo root and set Vercel project root to frontend (or create proper monorepo config) or alternatively plan to deploy backend separately (Render/Railway/Fly.io/Docker); 3) refactor backend to export the FastAPI app (no uvicorn.run) and/or move it into api/ for Vercel functions if you choose Vercel; 4) make backend config/data use environment variables and avoid local JSON persistence or add durable storage; 5) document required env vars and deployment steps in README and consider handling Playwright via a separate service or Docker image.
