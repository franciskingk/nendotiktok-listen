Here are\n   [Brokk's explanation of \"how does bm25 search work?\"](https://gist.github.com/jbellis/c2696f58f22a1c1a2aa450fdf45c21f4)\n   in the [DataStax Cassandra repo](https://github.com/datastax/cassandra/) (a brand-new feature, not in anyone's training set), starting cold\n   with no context, compared to\n   [Claude Code's (probably the second-best code RAG out there)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3f77ea58-9fe3-4eab-8698-ec4e20cf1974).\n1. Automatically determine the most-related classes to your working context and summarize them\n1. Parse a stacktrace and add source for all the methods to your context\n1. Add source for all the usages of a class, field, or method to your context\n1. Parse \"anonymous\" context pieces from external commands\n1. Build/lint your project and ask the LLM to fix errors autonomously\n1. Break down large tasks into smaller ones\n\n... All while leaving you, the human supervisor, in full control.\n\nThese allow some simple but powerful patterns:\n- \"Here is the diff for commit X, which introduced a regression.  Here is the stacktrace\n  of the error and the full source of the methods involved.  Find the bug.\"\n- \"Here are the usages of Foo.bar.  Is parameter zep always loaded from cache?\"\n\n</text>\n<goal>\nSummarize the text in 5 words or fewer.\n</goal>\n"

The project consists of a Vite-based React frontend and a Python backend (FastAPI/Flask) defined in `api.py`. While the local development environment works as expected, the production deployment fails to route requests correctly.\n\nPlease review the `frontend/vite.config.ts` and the `api.py` routing logic to identify why the application is failing to resolve paths. Based on the provided workspace, I need a `vercel.json` configuration or an update to the build settings that ensures frontend routes are redirected to `index.html` (SPA routing) and that the `/api` prefix correctly proxies to the Python backend.\n\nCould you provide the specific configuration changes needed to resolve this 404 error, ensuring the frontend `NotFound.tsx` component only triggers for genuinely missing pages rather than during initial routing?\n</text>\n<goal>\nSummarize the text in 5 words or fewer.\n</goal>\n"
