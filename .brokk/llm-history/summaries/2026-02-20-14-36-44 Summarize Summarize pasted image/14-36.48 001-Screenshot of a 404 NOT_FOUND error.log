**Describing an image**

The user is asking for a brief description of an image. I should keep it short and straightforward. For instance, saying "screenshot of a 404 NOT_FOUND error message" seems like a good option. I'll remember to be concise and clear in my response. Keeping it simple is key! Alright, I feel ready to provide that short phrase!

## text
Screenshot of a 404 NOT_FOUND error message dialog.
