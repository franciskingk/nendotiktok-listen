## reasoningContent
**Describing the image**

The user wants me to describe an image briefly, like saying "screenshot of code" or "diagram of system." I need to respond with a short phrase. It might be something like "Deployment error screen showing GitHub connection failure." So, I’ll keep it concise and avoid identifying any people. Keeping it clear and straightforward is essential for effective communication!

## text
Screenshot of a deployment error screen showing a Git repository ↔ GitHub connection failure.
