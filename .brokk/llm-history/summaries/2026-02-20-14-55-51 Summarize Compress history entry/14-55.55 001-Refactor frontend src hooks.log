<message type=user>
  Give a detailed but concise summary of this task.
  A third party should be able to understand what happened without reference to the original.
  Focus on information that would be useful for someone doing further work on the project described in the task.
  
  Here is the task to summarize. Do not include XML tags or other markup.
  <task sequence=4>
    <message type=user>
      Refactor `frontend/src/hooks/useTikTokData.ts` to replace all hardcoded instances of `http://127.0.0.1:8001` with a dynamic `API_BASE_URL` constant. 
      The constant should be derived from `import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL`, falling back to `http://127.0.0.1:8001` only if the environment variable is not set.
      
      Create a `frontend/.env.example` file documenting `VITE_API_URL`.
      
      **Acceptance:**
      Check that `frontend/src/hooks/useTikTokData.ts` no longer contains `http://127.0.0.1:8001` and instead uses `import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL`.
      Verify `frontend/.env.example` exists and includes `VITE_API_URL`.
      Verify `frontend/.env` is in `.gitignore` (if gitignore exists).
      
      **Key Locations:**
      frontend/src/hooks/useTikTokData.ts
      frontend/.env.example
      
      **Key Discoveries:**
      frontend/src/hooks/useTikTokData.ts has multiple fetch calls to localhost.

# Response:

## reasoningContent
I'm focusing on creating a concise summary for the task, including all the essential details like files, changes, acceptance criteria, environment handling, and any updates to the gitignore. The developer mentioned to ensure it’s all in a single paragraph without line breaks. I want to make sure this summary is useful for future reference, so I’ll be careful to capture everything clearly and precisely. Let's get this crafted the right way!

## text
Refactor frontend/src/hooks/useTikTokData.ts to remove all hardcoded occurrences of http://127.0.0.1:8001 and replace them with a single API_BASE_URL constant that reads from import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL and falls back to http://127.0.0.1:8001 when the env var is not set; update all fetch calls in that file to use API_BASE_URL; add frontend/.env.example documenting VITE_API_URL; ensure frontend/.env is listed in .gitignore (if a .gitignore exists). Acceptance criteria: the file frontend/src/hooks/useTikTokData.ts contains no literal http://127.0.0.1:8001 and uses import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL (via the API_BASE_URL constant), frontend/.env.example exists and includes VITE_API_URL, and frontend/.env is ignored by git. Note: current discovery shows useTikTokData.ts has multiple fetch calls to localhost that must be updated.
