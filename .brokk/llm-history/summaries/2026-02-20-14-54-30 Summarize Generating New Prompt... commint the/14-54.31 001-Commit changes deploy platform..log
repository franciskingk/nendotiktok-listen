  # What Brokk can do
  
  1. Ridiculously good agentic search / code retrieval. Better than Claude Code, better than Sourcegraph,
     better than Augment Code.  Here are
     [Brokk's explanation of "how does bm25 search work?"](https://gist.github.com/jbellis/c2696f58f22a1c1a2aa450fdf45c21f4)
     in the [DataStax Cassandra repo](https://github.com/datastax/cassandra/) (a brand-new feature, not in anyone's training set), starting cold
     with no context, compared to
     [Claude Code's (probably the second-best code RAG out there)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3f77ea58-9fe3-4eab-8698-ec4e20cf1974).
  1. Automatically determine the most-related classes to your working context and summarize them
  1. Parse a stacktrace and add source for all the methods to your context
  1. Add source for all the usages of a class, field, or method to your context
  1. Parse "anonymous" context pieces from external commands
  1. Build/lint your project and ask the LLM to fix errors autonomously
  1. Break down large tasks into smaller ones
  
  ... All while leaving you, the human supervisor, in full control.
  
  These allow some simple but powerful patterns:
  - "Here is the diff for commit X, which introduced a regression.  Here is the stacktrace
    of the error and the full source of the methods involved.  Find the bug."
  - "Here are the usages of Foo.bar.  Is parameter zep always loaded from cache?"
