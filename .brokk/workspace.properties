textHistory=["I am deploying this project to Vercel and encountering a `404 NOT_FOUND` error upon accessing the application. The project consists of a Vite-based React frontend and a Python backend (FastAPI/Flask) defined in `api.py`. While the local development environment works as expected, the production deployment fails to route requests correctly.\\n\\nPlease review the `frontend/vite.config.ts` and the `api.py` routing logic to identify why the application is failing to resolve paths. Based on the provided workspace, I need a `vercel.json` configuration or an update to the build settings that ensures frontend routes are redirected to `index.html` (SPA routing) and that the `/api` prefix correctly proxies to the Python backend.\\n\\nCould you provide the specific configuration changes needed to resolve this 404 error, ensuring the frontend `NotFound.tsx` component only triggers for genuinely missing pages rather than during initial routing?"]
